            <h2>About Penguins</h2>
            <p class="p-outside">
                Penguins are flightless seabirds that live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere.
                They are highly adapted for life in water, with streamlined bodies and strong flippers.
                Their black and white coloring provides camouflage while swimming.

                    Male penguins often propose to their mates by presenting them with pebbles.
                    If the female accepts the pebble, they become a pair, showcasing a charming
                    courtship ritual.
