    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>5 tbsp butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup fresh milk, warm</li>
        <li>1 pouch rapid-rise yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 raw egg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em><strong>Activate the yeast.</strong> 
            <p>Start stirring 1 pouch of rapid rise yeast, ½ cup of white sugar, and 1 ¼ cup of warm, fresh milk. Keep doing this until you can see that the yeast and sugar have dissolved completely.</p> </em></li>
        <li><em>
        <strong> Combine the dry ingredients</strong> 
            <p>Then in a separate mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients, starting off with the 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 cups of bread flour, sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of baking powder. Stir this as well.</p></em></li>
        <li><em>
        <strong> Knead the dough</strong> 
            <p>Use a flat surface for kneading the dough until you achieve a fine texture. You could also utilize a stand mixer with a dough hook if you’d like to have an easier kneading process. Also, mold the dough until it becomes a round shape. Then place it back in your mixing bowl and cover it with a damp cloth. You will be waiting for at least 1 hour to let the dough rise.</p></em></li>
        <li><em>
        <strong> Divide and slice the dough</strong> 
            
            <p>Place your dough on a flat surface, and using a dough slicer, separate this into 4 equal parts. Form a cylindrical shape with these parts by rolling them, then slice each cylindrical dough diagonally. Take note that these slices will later be our individual pieces of pandesal.</p></em></li>
        <li><em>
        <strong> Roll the dough in breadcrumbs and let it rise</strong> 
            
            <p>After this, roll your sliced dough over breadcrumbs, and put this in a baking tray lined with wax paper. Since we expect our pieces of pandesal will be rising, make sure to provide enough space among the dough. Then leave it in the tray with breadcrumbs for 10 to 15 minutes more for it to rise.</p></em></li>
        <li><em>
        <strong> Bake your pandesal</strong> 
            
            <p>Get your oven ready for baking by pre-heating it at 375 °F for a total of 10 minutes. Then we’re good to go with our tray of dough! Bake this in your oven for 15 minutes. When this is done, turn your oven off. Then place your warm, delicious batch fresh out of the oven on your serving plate or tray of choice.</p></em></li>
